# C function pointer practice
## by rohan

This program demonstrates how to use pointers to functions in C
We have two functions with the same 'signature' (return type and arguments)

In this case the two functions are the permutation and combination mathematical functions. 
We have a variable for storing a reference to the function, read the desired operation
from user, and then we point our functionPTR variable to it. 

We then see how you can call functions from pointer variables
